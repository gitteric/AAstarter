# AAstarter

This app waits for a trigger from [my fork of AAGateWay](https://github.com/olivluca/AAGateWay) and starts Android Auto instructing it to connect back to AAGateway.

You can build it or get it from the [Releases](https://github.com/olivluca/AAstarter/releases) section and you have to install it on the master phone.
